# A mobile first decentralized credit plaform for zero-interest rate loans built on Celo

About 220 million people in the United States have a credit score. Of them, roughly 68 million have a rating that is classified as “poor.” This means for a large segment of the population, their credit score affects their ability to lend money sometimes necessary to just get by. Even worse, once an individual is deemed untrustworthy, the resulting higher interest premiums on these loans make it nearly impossible for people to gain their financial independence. Uniquely, decentralized finance promises to overcome the inherent faults of credit scoring, by offering a viable alternative in trustless lending through over-collateralization. However, the current array of trustless lending protocols are completely unusable for the average consumer. A highly liquid money market protocol like Compound only offers floating rates. For the consumer market, that translates to unpredictable and expensive access to credit. 

On a mission to democratize credit, Lendvie is a trustless lending protocol that is even a step further from the recent emergence of fixed-rate lending protocols. Using the negative redemption rates on Reflexer, Lendvie can offer zero-interest-rate loans while still generating yield for liquidity providers. For the first time in both the decentralized and traditional financial system, people will have permissionless access to cheap credit!
